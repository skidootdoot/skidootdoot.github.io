      <p style="color: rgb(213,236,223)">A reclusive oddball. Known locally for being seculuded and delirious, they rarely leave their home in search of anything. Disliked by locals, the only thing that keeps them company are their many trinkets and collectibles. They want for little, but a kind word and a warm hand do enough.</p>
      <p2 style="color: rgb(213,236,223)">The Hermit does not know what draws them to the trader's table, but they are ever curious about what the trader may have. Their curiosity often overpowers their dislike of entering highly populated areas, and the trader is the perfect opportunity for them to get what they may need.</p2>
