    <h1>The Hierophant</h1>
    <p>The Hierophant is a religious zealot. The only thing that takes solid form in their head is their dedication their god. Their god is not one we know, and their commitment to this god is not to be taken lightly. Their religious fervour keeps them alienated from most, but they have essential skills in healing, writing, and other worldly matters. They seek to spread the word of their god under the pretense of aid, but they are not docile. If they must strike, they will strike to kill.</p>
    <p2>The Hierophant does not search for anything they could not get from their god, but they would be remiss to not engage with the trader. Traders carry not only goods, but also information. Information is always useful to the Hierophant, and they will seek anything that will aid them in their journey to spread their religion.</p2>
