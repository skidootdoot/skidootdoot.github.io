    <h1>The Hero</h1>
    <p>The Hero has no name other than that given by the people. They are strengthened by kindness, committed to justice, and will do anything for those they love. They are well respected and recognized across the land. Their symbol brings hope.</p>
    <p2>The Hero seeks anything the trader will give them: guidance, courage, or a token to bolster them on their journey. They will not rest until they have completed what they set out to do.</p2>
